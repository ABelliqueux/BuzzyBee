# BuzzyBee for 32bit Jam 2021  

A homebrew PSX game that can run on a PSX emulator or a real PSX (so long it can run unsigned CDs).

The game works similar to Flappy-Bird in that tapping X increases the bee's speed up.

Pressing "Select" pauses the game.
Red bars at the top represent energy (they are continuosly reducing due to flying...)
Touching flowers will give you an energy boost
Hitting a wasp will significantly reduce your health.
The goal is to work for as long as you can to make the Queen Bee happy.

## Game Concept  
  
![Sketch of the idea](readme_images/concept.jpg)
  
It will hopefully be a simple 2D platformer. The idea is to be a cross between a side-scrolling Super Mario like game and a FlappyBird mechanics.  
That is assuming I ever get it done.  
  
### Early prototype  
We had to abondon this prototype because the author of the bee sprite bailed on us....

Adapated the logo for the 32bit jam from Arch-D-Triumph to our PSX CD boot

## Intro Screen
I did this first, but should have coded it last or made a code way of skipping it....
